Test script to validate the "Launch Chat" button removal for better delete button access
"""

print("🗑️ Delete Button Access Improvement")
print("=" * 60)

print("✅ CHANGE MADE:")
print("• Removed 'Launch Chat' button from the dropdown menu")
print("• This reduces menu items and makes delete button more accessible")
print("• Simplified the dropdown to focus on essential actions")

print("\n📋 DROPDOWN MENU NOW CONTAINS:")
print("1. 👁️ View Details")
print("2. ▶️ Manual Trigger (if agent has triggers)")
print("3. ✏️ Edit Agent") 
print("4. ➖ [SEPARATOR LINE]")
print("5. 🗑️ Delete Agent (RED)")

print("\n🎯 BENEFITS:")
print("• Fewer menu items = shorter dropdown")
print("• Delete button is now closer to the top")
print("• More likely to be visible within viewport")
print("• Less UI clutter and confusion")
print("• Users can still access chat via 'View Details'")

print("\n🔧 REASONING:")
print("• Launch Chat was redundant (accessible via View Details)")
print("• Delete is a critical action that needs to be easily accessible")
print("• Shorter menus are more user-friendly")
print("• Reduces chance of dropdown being cut off")

print("\n📱 HOW TO TEST:")
print("1. Refresh the agents page: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/agents")
print("2. Click the three dots (⋮) on any agent card")
print("3. Look for the dropdown menu with fewer items")
print("4. The delete button should now be more visible")
print("5. Should see red 'Delete Agent' button at the bottom")

print("\n✅ EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:")
print("• Dropdown menu appears faster (fewer items to render)")
print("• Delete button is more prominent")
print("• Less scrolling needed in the dropdown")
print("• Better overall user experience")
print("• Easier to find and click delete button")

print("\n🎉 DELETE BUTTON SHOULD NOW BE FULLY ACCESSIBLE!")
print("The removal of Launch Chat makes room for the delete functionality.")
