# Improved Automation Detection - FIXED

## Problem Identified ✅

The agent was treating **informational content** as **automation requests**:

**Example**:

- User: "Company (DXTR Labs) info – a refined company overview/pitch summary. Competitor research..."
- Expected: Conversational response about the company
- Actual: ❌ Automation workflow triggered

## Root Cause

The old automation detection was too broad and triggered on keywords like:

- "research" (even in "competitor research")
- "investors" (even in "investor pitch data")
- "find" (even in "funding info")

## New Improved Logic ✅

### **Informational Keywords** (→ Conversational)

```python
informational_keywords = [
    'company info', 'about us', 'our company', 'company overview', 'pitch summary',
    'competitor research', 'market stats', 'funding info', 'company profiles',
    'investor pitch data', 'market size', 'positioning'
]
```

### **Action Keywords** (→ Automation)

```python
automation_action_keywords = [
    'send email', 'email to', 'find and email', 'search for and send',
    'create workflow', 'automate this', 'execute automation',
    'find top 10 and email', 'research investors and email'
]
```

### **Detection Logic**

```python
if has_email_recipient and has_email_action:
    → AUTOMATION (email with recipient)
elif is_clear_automation and not is_informational:
    → AUTOMATION (clear action request)
elif is_informational and not is_clear_action:
    → CONVERSATIONAL (company info/context)
else:
    → CONVERSATIONAL (default for ambiguous cases)
```

## Expected Behavior Now ✅

### **Informational Input** → Conversational

**User**: "Company (DXTR Labs) info – refined overview, competitor research data, market stats"  
**Expected Response**: "That's great information about DXTR Labs! I can see you have a comprehensive overview including competitor research and market data. How can I help you with automation workflows for your business?"

### **Action Input** → Automation

**User**: "Find top 10 competitors and email them our pitch"  
**Expected Response**: AI service selection for automation workflow

### **Email Input** → Automation

**User**: "Send company overview to investor@vc.com"  
**Expected Response**: AI service selection for email automation

## Backend Status

- ✅ **Server restarted** with improved logic
- ✅ **Agent isolation** maintained
- ✅ **Precise automation detection** implemented
- ✅ **Conversational mode** for informational content

## Test Case Results

The agent should now:

1. **Recognize company information** as conversational context
2. **Respond enthusiastically** about the company details
3. **Ask what automation** the user wants help with
4. **Only trigger automation** on clear action requests

The fix ensures agents distinguish between **sharing information** vs **requesting actions**.
