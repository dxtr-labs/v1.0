# 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE DEBUGGING GUIDE

## Current Status

- ✅ Backend: Correctly structured to return editable email preview
- ✅ Frontend: Has the editable dialog interface
- ❌ Integration: Dialog not appearing when it should

## Next Steps for Debugging

### 1. Test the Workflow Again

1. **Open the agent chat interface** in your browser
2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12) and go to **Console** tab
3. **Make the request**: "draft a sales pitch highlight key achievements of dxtr labs and send to slakshanand1105@gmail.com"
4. **Select "inhouse"** when prompted

### 2. Look for These Debug Messages

#### In Browser Console:

```
🚨🚨🚨 COMPREHENSIVE FRONTEND DEBUG 🚨🚨🚨
🔍 Response Status: workflow_preview
🔍 Has workflow_preview: true
🔍 Has email_preview: true
```

#### In API Route Console:

```
🎯 API ROUTE DEBUG: POST request received at /api/chat/mcpai
🚨 CRITICAL DEBUG - RAW BACKEND RESPONSE
🚨 Status: workflow_preview
```

#### In Backend Logs:

```
🎯 DEBUG: About to call agent_processor.process_with_agent
🎯 CRITICAL DEBUG: MCP Response Status: workflow_preview
```

### 3. Diagnosis Based on Logs

#### Scenario A: No API logs appear

- **Issue**: Request not reaching API route
- **Solution**: Check network tab for failed requests

#### Scenario B: API logs but no backend logs

- **Issue**: API route not calling backend correctly
- **Solution**: Check authentication or URL routing

#### Scenario C: Backend logs but wrong status

- **Issue**: Backend not returning workflow_preview
- **Solution**: Check MCP engine logic

#### Scenario D: All logs correct but no dialog

- **Issue**: Frontend React state management
- **Solution**: Check `showWorkflowDialog` state

### 4. Expected Working Flow

1. **Initial Request** → `ai_service_selection` status
2. **Service Selection** → `workflow_preview` status
3. **Frontend Detects** → Sets `showWorkflowDialog = true`
4. **Dialog Renders** → Editable email interface appears

### 5. Debugging Commands Ready

I've added comprehensive logging to:

- **Frontend**: Logs every response detail
- **API Route**: Logs request/response flow
- **Backend**: Logs MCP processing

### 6. If Dialog Still Doesn't Appear

Check these React states in browser console:

```javascript
// In browser console, inspect the chat component state
$0.showWorkflowDialog; // Should be true
$0.workflowPreview; // Should contain email_preview object
```

### 7. Quick Test Alternative

If the main flow fails, try this direct approach:

- **Message**: "service:inhouse" (skip to step 2)
- This should directly trigger workflow_preview if conversation history is preserved

## Expected Final Result

When working correctly, you should see:

- ✅ Dialog box appears with email content
- ✅ Editable subject line field
- ✅ Editable email content textarea
- ✅ "Confirm & Execute" button
- ✅ Workflow steps visualization
