1. **Enhanced Automation Detection:**

   - Added keywords: `"draft", "write", "pitch", "generate"`
   - Increased search range from 50 to 100 characters
   - Now properly detects content creation requests

2. **Smart Content Recognition:**

   - Detects when user wants AI to generate content
   - Extracts the content topic (e.g., "sales pitch for healthy ice cream")
   - Provides specific responses about content generation

3. **Better Email + Content Handling:**
   - Recognizes email + content generation patterns
   - Creates appropriate workflow types
   - Gives detailed feedback about what will happen

## ✅ Success Indicators:

- ✅ Should say "AI Email automation created!"
- ✅ Should mention drafting the specific content type
- ✅ Should include the recipient email
- ✅ Should indicate AI will generate content automatically
- ✅ No more generic "I can help you create automations!" responses

## 🚫 What Should NOT Happen:

- ❌ Generic fallback: "I can help you create automations! Try..."
- ❌ Simple response: "Email automation created! Ready to send"
- ❌ Processing lock message (unless sent rapidly)
- ❌ Cache responses for different email addresses

## 🎯 Quick Validation:

**Test Sequence:**

1. Send: `draft a sales pitch to sell healthy ice cream and send email to slakshanand1105@gmail.com`
2. Expected: Specific AI content generation response
