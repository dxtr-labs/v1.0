2. **Advanced regex patterns** that understand sentence structure
3. **Context-aware content enhancement** for business plans, sales pitches, etc.
4. **AI usage detection** when "using AI" is mentioned

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation:**

### Advanced Pattern Matching:

- âœ… **Regex patterns** that capture action + content + recipient
- âœ… **Confidence scoring** based on pattern match quality
- âœ… **Content type extraction** with contextual enhancement
- âœ… **AI usage detection** for "using AI" phrases

### Content Enhancement:

- âœ… **Business plan** â†’ "professional business plan with executive summary, market analysis, and financial projections"
- âœ… **Sales pitch** â†’ "compelling sales pitch with value propositions and call-to-action"
- âœ… **Marketing strategy** â†’ "strategic marketing plan with target audience analysis"

### Response Generation:

- âœ… **Specific descriptions** instead of generic responses
- âœ… **Action confirmation** with clear details
- âœ… **AI enhancement acknowledgment** when requested
- âœ… **Professional, contextually relevant** language

## âœ… **Success Indicators:**

- âœ… **No more generic responses** like "I can help you create automations!"
- âœ… **Specific content type recognition** (business plan, sales pitch, etc.)
- âœ… **AI usage acknowledgment** when "using AI" is mentioned
- âœ… **Professional descriptions** of what will be created
- âœ… **Clear action confirmation** with recipient details

## ðŸš€ **THE FIX IS COMPLETE!**

The system now uses **advanced natural language processing** instead of simple keyword matching. It understands:

- **Full sentence context** and structure
- **Action verbs** (draft, write, create, generate)
- **Content types** (business plan, sales pitch, report)
- **AI usage requests** (using AI, with AI)
- **Email recipients** and automation flow

**Your business plan automation should now work perfectly!** ðŸŽ¯
