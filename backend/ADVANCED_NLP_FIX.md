- **Contextual grouping** to extract action, content type, and recipient
- **Confidence scoring** based on pattern match quality

### 2. Content Enhancement:

- **Business plan** → "professional business plan with executive summary, market analysis, and financial projections"
- **Sales pitch** → "compelling sales pitch with value propositions and call-to-action"
- **Report** → "comprehensive report with data analysis and conclusions"

### 3. Intent Analysis:

- **Urgency detection**: Identifies "asap", "urgent", "quickly"
- **Content type classification**: Business, sales, technical, etc.

### 4. Response Generation:

- **Specific descriptions** instead of generic responses
- **Action confirmation** with clear next steps
- **Professional language** matching the content type

## ✅ **Success Indicators:**

- ✅ **AI enhancement acknowledgment** when "using AI" is mentioned
- ✅ **Professional descriptions** of what will be created

- ✅ **No more generic fallbacks** like "I can help you create automations!"

## 🚫 **What Should NOT Happen:**
